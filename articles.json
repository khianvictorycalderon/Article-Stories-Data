        <h2><i>5 Web Design Principles:</i></h2>
        <ul>
         <li>
           <b>Balance</b>
           <ul>
            <li><i>This refers to the distribution of visual weight within a design. It can be symmetrical (evenly distributed) or asymmetrical (unevenly distributed but still visually balanced). The goal is to create a sense of equilibrium that is pleasing to the eye.</i></li>
           </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
           <b>Alignment</b>
           <ul>
            <li><i>This principle involves arranging elements so they line up with each other or with the overall design grid. Proper alignment helps create a sense of order and organization, guiding the viewer's eye through the design.</i></li>
           </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
           <b>Proximity</b>
           <ul>
            <li><i>Proximity refers to placing related items close to each other. This helps to create a visual relationship between elements, making it easier for viewers to understand how different parts of the design are related.</i></li>
           </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
           <b>Repetition</b>
           <ul>
            <li><i>Repetition involves using similar elements throughout a design to create consistency and unity. This can include repeating colors, shapes, fonts, or patterns to tie the design together and reinforce a cohesive look.</i></li>
           </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
           <b>Contrast</b>
           <ul>
            <li><i>Contrast is the difference between elements in a design, such as color, size, or shape. It helps to highlight important information, create visual interest, and guide the viewer’s attention to key areas of the design.</i></li>
           </ul>
         </li>
        </ul>

      desc: "Uncover the dark side of networking / MLM(Multi-Level Marketing)",
      fullDesc: `<p>(Sample Article Only)</p><p>Multi-level marketing (MLM) has gained notoriety for its controversial practices and potential pitfalls, shedding light on several darker aspects within the industry.</p> <p><strong>1. High Attrition Rates:</strong> MLM companies often experience high turnover rates among distributors. Many participants invest time and money but end up leaving without achieving substantial financial returns. The business model relies heavily on recruiting new members to replace those who drop out.</p> <p><strong>2. Misleading Income Promises:</strong> MLM companies frequently promote the potential for lucrative earnings, showcasing top earners as examples of success. However, these earnings are often not representative of the average participant's experience. Many distributors find themselves earning little to no profit after factoring in expenses like product purchases, training fees, and marketing materials.</p> <p><strong>3. Product Overpricing and Quality Concerns:</strong> Products sold through MLMs can be criticized for being overpriced compared to similar items available in retail stores. There are also concerns about product quality, as the emphasis may be more on recruitment than on product development or consumer satisfaction.</p> <p><strong>4. Emphasis on Recruitment:</strong> MLMs often prioritize recruiting new distributors over selling products. Participants are encouraged to build their "downline" by recruiting others into the business. This can lead to market saturation and intense competition among distributors within the same network.</p> <p><strong>5. Complex Compensation Structures:</strong> Compensation plans in MLMs can be complex and difficult to understand. They often reward recruiting and building a large network of distributors rather than actual retail sales. This focus on recruitment can overshadow genuine product distribution.</p> <p><strong>6. Legal and Regulatory Issues:</strong> MLMs have faced legal scrutiny and regulatory challenges in various countries due to concerns about deceptive practices, pyramid schemes, and violations of consumer protection laws. Some MLM companies have been fined or shut down for operating illegal pyramid schemes disguised as legitimate business opportunities.</p> <p><strong>7. Social and Personal Relationships:</strong> Joining an MLM can strain personal relationships as distributors may feel pressured to recruit friends and family members. This pressure can lead to tension and conflict if individuals are not interested in or skeptical of the business opportunity.</p> <p><strong>8. Psychological Impact:</strong> Participants in MLMs may experience psychological stress from financial losses, unmet expectations, or feeling misled by promises of easy success. The pressure to maintain positivity and recruit new members can also create emotional strain.</p> <p>While some individuals may find success in MLMs, the industry's structure and practices have raised ethical concerns and skepticism. Prospective participants are advised to conduct thorough research, consider potential risks, and assess whether the business model aligns with their financial goals and ethical values before joining.</p>`,

      fullDesc: "<p>(Sample Article Only)</p><p>Cooking oil can be dangerous due to several factors related to its use and disposal. When used improperly, cooking oil can pose fire hazards in kitchens, especially when heated to high temperatures. The high heat can cause oil to splatter, leading to burns or fires.</p> <p>Improper disposal of cooking oil can also have environmental consequences. Pouring used oil down drains can clog pipes and sewer systems, leading to costly repairs and environmental pollution. Oil that reaches water bodies can harm aquatic life and disrupt ecosystems.</p> <p>Consuming excessive amounts of cooking oil, especially oils high in saturated fats, can contribute to health issues such as obesity, heart disease, and high cholesterol levels. It's important to use cooking oils in moderation and choose healthier options, such as olive oil or canola oil, which contain unsaturated fats.</p> <p>To mitigate the dangers associated with cooking oil, it's advisable to handle it carefully while cooking, use proper storage containers, and dispose of used oil responsibly. Recycling used cooking oil for biodiesel production or other purposes can also reduce environmental impact and promote sustainability.</p> <p>Overall, while cooking oil is essential for food preparation, understanding its potential risks and taking precautions can help ensure safe and responsible use in kitchens and beyond.</p>",

      fullDesc: `<p>(Sample Article Only)</p><p>The concept that "the rich don't work for money" challenges traditional notions of wealth accumulation and financial independence. Coined in personal finance literature and popularized by Robert Kiyosaki in his book "Rich Dad Poor Dad," this idea suggests that true wealth is not primarily generated through conventional employment, but rather through assets, investments, and passive income streams.</p> <p>According to this philosophy, individuals who focus solely on earning a paycheck are limited by trading their time for money. Instead, the wealthy prioritize building and acquiring income-generating assets such as real estate, stocks, businesses, or intellectual property. These assets are designed to generate passive income, which continues to flow regardless of whether the individual is actively working.</p> <p>Proponents of this mindset argue that relying solely on earned income from a job can perpetuate a cycle of financial dependence and limited growth. By contrast, investing in assets that appreciate in value or produce ongoing income allows individuals to accumulate wealth and achieve financial freedom over time.</p> <p>The principle of "the rich don't work for money" emphasizes the importance of financial education and strategic investment decisions. It encourages individuals to think beyond traditional employment and consider long-term wealth-building strategies that can provide financial security and independence.</p> <p>While controversial and often debated, this concept has influenced many to rethink their approach to personal finance and wealth management. It encourages individuals to cultivate a mindset focused on building assets and generating passive income, rather than relying solely on earned wages or salaries.</p> <p>Ultimately, whether one subscribes to this philosophy or not, it underscores the broader idea that financial success often requires strategic planning, investment in income-producing assets, and a proactive approach to managing one's financial future.</p> <p>As such, the notion that "the rich don't work for money" serves as a provocative reminder to consider alternative paths to wealth creation and financial independence, challenging conventional wisdom and prompting individuals to explore new opportunities for building lasting prosperity.</p>`,
